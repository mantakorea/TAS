### TestProject Setup

1. Register to [TestProject](https://app.testproject.io/#/home)
1. Login to TestProject
1. Download [TestAgent](https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk?lang=Java) Java version and Install it
   * It may request admin authority. In this case, you can contact Mr. Hyungrak Kim.

### Trouble Shooting with TestAgent
The TestAgent desktop shortcut that was created during installation resides in C:\Users\Public, and this prompts for admin authority.

To fix this
1. Delete existing shortcut "TestProject Agent" on desktop
1. While Yongjo is logged in, navigate to "C:\Program Files\TestProject Agent", locate TestProjectAgent.exe, right click on it and create a shortcut to desktop.
